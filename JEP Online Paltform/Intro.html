      <h2>Founded in 1972, the Joint Educational Project (JEP) is one of the oldest and largest service-learning programs in the United States.</h2>
      	<p>Each year over 2,000 USC students enroll in one of several JEP courses that combine academic coursework with hands-on experience in neighborhoods surrounding the university.</p>
      	<p>Students may also participate as volunteers on a non-credit basis.</p>
      	<p>By enabling students to learn firsthand about critical issues facing urban communities, JEP offers an authentic service-learning experience in schools, health-care facilities, agencies and community partners.</p>
    	<p>If you are near/on the USC campus and would like to become a partner with us, please fill out an application as a community member or USC student organization or as a local neighborhood school and we will get back to you.</p>
